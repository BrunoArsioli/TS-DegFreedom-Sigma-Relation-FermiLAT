        "# Fermi-LAT: Convert TS + Degree of Freedom --> $\\sigma$  \n",
        "\n",
        "This short routine is intended as a tool to calculate the  statistical significance (\\sigma) of a $\\gamma$-ray signature, detected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). The sigma value depends on the number of Degrees of Freedom (dof) involved in a Likelihood Analysis and the resulting Test Statistic (TS) value. \n",

        "**A standard analysis with Fermi-LAT** involves four degrees of freedom. Two associated to the uncertain position of the source (R.A.,Dec.), and another two associated with the shape of the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum that -in the simplest case- can be assumed to follow a power-law, $dN/dE = N_0 (E/E_0)^\\Gamma $. Here, $N_0$ is the pre-factor or normalization parameter [photons/cm^2/s/MeV], $\\Gamma$ is the photon index, and $E_0$ is the pivot-energy [MeV] where both $N_0$ and $\\Gamma$ are estimated. Usually, the $E_0$ value has to be fixed during the analysis, otherwise, the number of degrees of freedom brings far too much uncertainty to the $N_0$, $\\Gamma$ and $E_0$ values. Still, one should run the analysis testing over a reasoable range of $E_0$ values (from 500 MeV up to Tens of GeV) to optimize the $N_0$ and $\\Gamma$ estimates. This is the typical approach to Fermi-LAT data, if the analysis is solo based in $\\gamma$-ray information (blind to information collected from other bands).\n",

        "In this case, a signature with TS = 25, from a likelihood analysis with 4 degrees of freedom, corresponds to a 4.05$\\sigma$ detection. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Multifrequency Information:** However, it is possible to take into account multifrequency information, and lower the uncertainty of the analysis, by fixing the position of the $\\gamma$-ray emitter. Please check the [2BIGB $\\gamma$-ray catalogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08912). This is perfectly fine if one considers the position of Blazars -especially out of the galactic plane- because blazars are the dominant extragalactic $\\gamma$-ray sources. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, if the position of the $\\gamma$-ray candidate is known, there are only two degrees of freedom for the likelihood analysis: the ones associated with the power-law spectral modeling. \n",

        "A signature with TS = 19.8, deduced from a likelihood analysis with only 2 degrees of freedom, corresponds to a 4.05$\\sigma$ detection. Therefore, if one searches for gamma-ray signatures associated with blazars (as for the 2BIGB catalogue), a TS=19.8 threshold is equivalent to a TS=25 blind search detection threshold. \n",
